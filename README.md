# CopyThat

CopyThat is a browser extension that currently only operates on Chromium browsers and is soon going to be added to the Chrome Web Store. In the meantime, feel free to download the source code and load the unpacked extension. This project uses Manifest Version 3 as well as HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

CopyThat aims to make symbols and accents easily accessible, whether through a popup or through a mini-toolbar. Both contain buttons which contain an accent/symbol, click on them and the text will be copied to your clipboard. The last ten recently used accents/symbols will remain in a separate location for easy access.
